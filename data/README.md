# Data

The pre-trained word vectors can be stored here. The word vectors should be stored row-wise, 
starting with the word followed by the values in its word vector. The values should be separated with spaces. 

The list of the most common words should be a new-line separated list of the most common words. 
The most common word should be placed first on the list.
